Code for Jersey City is a hands on active community group collaborating with the Jersey City Government to build open data, open source and open government in Jersey City. We believe in public sector innovation and the value of digital-government projects. Come join other developers, designers, data geeks, civic leaders, organizers, and idea-makers to volunteer and collaborate.
